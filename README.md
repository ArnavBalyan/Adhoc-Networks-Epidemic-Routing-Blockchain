# Secure Epidemic Routing using Blockchain in Opportunistic Internet of Things Networks.
The
algorithm presents a secure routing protocol based on the
delivery predictability of messages by integrating blockchain to
ensure security and privacy. The simulation result shows that
our proposed protocol outperforms some traditional routing
schemes like epidemic routing and PRoPHET (Probabilistic
Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity)
routing with more secure transmission.
