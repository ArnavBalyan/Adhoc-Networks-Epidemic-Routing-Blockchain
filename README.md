# Introduction:
The paper presents state of the art security algorithm to provide immutable data transmission in Adhoc Decentralized Networks. The algorithm presents a secure routing protocol based on the delivery predictability of data packets, various consensus mechanisms and an immutable blockchain to provide security in data exchanges. The simulation result shows that the proposed protocol outperforms some traditional routing schemes like epidemic routing and PRoPHET (Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity) routing with more secure transmission.
## About:
Traditional IoT uses several connected smart physical devices with an infrastructure-based network. Opportunistic IoTs , work on ad-hoc policies
with opportunistic network protocols using short-range communication technologies like zigbee, bluetooth, NFC (Near Field Communication), etc. Decentralized Opprtunistic Networks however, lack any infrastructure which compromises security and increases network vulnerabilities. This study proposed a blockchain based security solution which aims to secure OIoT Networks.
## Simulation Software:
