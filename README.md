# Introduction:
This paper presents  on improving security measures adhoc decentralized networks primarily using blockchain. The algorithm presents a secure routing protocol based on the delivery predictability of messages by integrating blockchain to ensure security and privacy. The simulation result shows that the proposed protocol outperforms some traditional routing schemes like epidemic routing and PRoPHET (Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity) routing with more secure transmission.
