# Introduction:
This paper presents state of the art blockchain algorithms to provide secure data transmission in Adhoc Decentralized Networks. The algorithm presents a secure routing protocol based on the delivery predictability of messages, various consensus mechanisms and an immutable blockchain to provide security in data exchanges. The simulation result shows that the proposed protocol outperforms some traditional routing schemes like epidemic routing and PRoPHET (Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity) routing with more secure transmission.
